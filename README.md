> A node.js module to easily create bots for Starcraft 2

The role of this package is to bring the official Starcraft 2 C++ API to node.js, through a native node module.
The whole API will be usable fully with the power of javascript, to perform an easiest way to create and debugg your bot.

## Installing / Getting started

This node.js module is a native node module, which means you need to compile it when you install it.
To do that, you'll need [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) module (which works with python 2.7).
So be sure to install python 2.7 as well as the Visual C++ Build Environment (for windows). Or follow the instructions listed here : [node-gyp instructions](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp).

Once it's done, you can clone this repository in the folder of you choice by typing the following command : 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Elkantor/sc2api.git
```

And type this command to install the module :

```shell
npm install
```

## Developing

### Built With
List main libraries, frameworks used including versions (React, Angular etc...)

### Prerequisites
What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.


### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/your-project.git
cd your-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing
give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Versioning

We can maybe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [link to tags on this repository](/tags).


## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
Explain what these tests test and why.

```shell
Give an example
```

## Style guide

Explain your code style and show how to check it.

## Api Reference

If the api is external, link to api documentation. If not describe your api including authentication methods as well as explaining all the endpoints with their required parameters.


## Database

Explaining what database (and version) has been used. Provide download links.
Documents your database design and schemas, relations etc... 

## Licensing

State what the license is and how to find the text version of the license.
